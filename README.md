# Project Details
### This project is part a project for EEE3088F in 2022
This project will design a HAT *(Hardware Attached on Top)* for a STM Discovery Board.

### Concept of the project
The HAT will be used as a water sensing module for agricultural purposes. It will have a moisture sensor located in the soil that the plants are growing in and a flow rate sensor connected to the irrigation system. These sensors will connect to a STM Discovery board, which will act as the brain of the system. This system is for indoor autonomous growing setups which has applications in disruptive agricultural industries like marijuana growing. The HAT is intended to be used in small scale, home-setups in order to automate the watering of the plant as well as small-scale, industrial applications in an emerging market.

## Repository Structure
### Each sub-folder contains different aspects relating to different parts of the project
* PCB: The KiCAD Project, Schematics & Layout and Project Libraries
* Firmware: Any software developed for the hardware or instructions on where to find relevant sofware in cases where it makes more sense to have this in its own dedicated repo make this a git submodule
* Docs:â€ŠProject documentation and component datasheets
* Production: The gerber files, BOM, Budget, or anything required by the fabrication houses
* Simulation: Any simulation files (SPICE) or design stage generated results (matlab or excel) 
* CAD: Any 3D models or mechanical designs for enclosures or support
