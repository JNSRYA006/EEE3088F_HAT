# Contributing to EEE3088F - Group 7's STMDiscovery HAT
We'd love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether that be:

- Reporting a bug in code or hardware
- Discussing the current state of the code or hardware
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, schematics and PCB designs, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

**For more information on the repo structure, and the project itself, refer to the [README.md file here](https://github.com/JNSRYA006/EEE3088F_HAT/blob/main/README.md)**

## We use KiCad 6.0 for PCB design

You can download [KiCad 6.0 here](https://www.kicad.org/download/), as well as taking a look at a KiCad footprint & schematic symbol library that we've used for this project and is updated on [GitHub here](https://github.com/JNSRYA006/KiCad6-Libraries/tree/45affb6bb0a9958807a18e10e5513b9167775a54). Otherwise, please take a look at the datasheets and make use of [**componentsearchengine**](https://componentsearchengine.com/) to download the appropriate footprints.

## All Code & Hardware Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the code & hardware. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.

3. If you've changed hardware in KiCad, update the documentation in the appropriate [Docs](https://github.com/JNSRYA006/EEE3088F_HAT/tree/main/Docs) folder.

   a. *E.g, update the BOM, ERC, DRC & Datasheets*

4. Issue that pull request and we'll read it and merge once we're happy!
